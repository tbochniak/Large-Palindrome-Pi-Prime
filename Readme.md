Introduction:
This project aims to find the largest palindromic prime numbers in the decimal expansion of Pi (3.1415...), as part of the SigmaGeek challenge.

Methodology:
To achieve this, we have searched through the first 100 trillion digits of Pi's decimal expansion using a Python script, Google Cloud and programming techniques to identify palindromic prime numbers.

Results:
The largest palindromic prime number found in the first 100 trillion digits of Pi is 9609457639843489367549069. This number has 25 digits and is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same backward as forward.

In addition to the largest palindrome prime number, we have also identified 3 palindromic numbers of 29 digits which are not prime.
